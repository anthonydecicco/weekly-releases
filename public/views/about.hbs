        <h1 class="section-heading">Purpose</h1>
        <h2 class="section-emphasis">I love music.</h2>
        <p>I love to listen to music, and I explore a wide range of genres and artists. About a year ago, I found it
            increasingly difficult to keep track of new music releases from my favorite artists. Having stopped using
            social
            media a few years back, I lost my primary source of staying up-to-date with new releases. Often, I would
            discover
            weeks, months, or even a year later that one of my favorite artists had released a new album.</p>
        <p>While Spotify offers the Release Radar playlist, it only features one song per artist per week, without any
            notification of updates. Additionally, only some artists' new albums or singles are promoted to users
            through
            emails or push notifications. So I decided to create a service that compiles a comprehensive list of
            songs
            and albums from the artists you follow and delivers it directly to your inbox, every week.</p>

        <h1 class="section-heading">How Does it Work?</h1>
        <p>When you authorize this application through your Spotify account, you grant permission to store your Spotify
            account information in our database. Rest assured, we never ask for your password or other
            sensitive
            information. We only request permission to view your username, email, your followed
            artists, your top artists, and the ability to modify your followed artists (future features may depend on
            this).
        </p>

        <p>
            Those permissions are needed for interfacing with the <a
                href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api" target="_blank">Spotify Web API</a>, enabling
            us to retrieve your followed artists and their releases. Weekly Releases processes this data, filters for
            the past seven days, and sends you an email with the latest
            releases, every Friday morning.</p>
