A project that uses the SpotifyAPI to fetch a user's followed artists, and from there, fetch the releases from each of the artists and filter for releases that came out in the last 7 days. 

To-do:
- Build out front-end (index and after a user has authenticated the app with their Spotify account)
- Request increase in API rate limit
- Clean up auth code (currently it's taken from the Code Flow example on Spotify's site)
